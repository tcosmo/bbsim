; This machine is referred as "complex counter" in the "Attacking BB(5)" paper by Marxen and Buntrock
; This machine does not halt, it is marked ? in the paper but the behavior can be explained quite simply
; The machine moves 0s like bubbles in long runs of 1s which it first splits that way: 11111111 -> 11011011011
; This behavior is recursive.
