; This machine halts if and only if Erdos' conjecture on powers of two is false:
;
; "For all n > 8, there is at least one 2 in the ternary representation of 2^n"
;
; P. Erdős. Some unconventional problems in number theory. Mathematics Magazine, 52(2):67–70, 1979.
;
; The machine has 5 states and 4 symbols
; States mul2_F and mul2_G run the FST that computes 2x in base 3 (reverse-ternary). 
; The other states are responsible for checking the conjecture and keeping track of the 3 known special cases:
; 1, 4 and 256 which are resepectively 1, 11 and 100111 in base 3.
;
; This machine was proven correct:
